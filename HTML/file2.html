    <p>HTML elements can be categorized into three main types:
        <br>
        1. Block Elements: These elements create a new block on the page, taking up the full width available (e.g., `div`, `p`, `h1`). They are used to structure the layout and separate content.
        <br>
            2. Inline Elements: These elements do not start on a new line and only take up as much width as necessary (e.g., `span`, `a`, `strong`). They are used to format small sections of content within block elements.
            <br>
            3. Void Elements (Self-closing elements): These elements do not have closing tags and are used for single tasks (e.g., `img`, `br`, `input`). They are used to insert content without requiring a closing tag.
